Making a Deck Class to Explore Object Oriented Programming

Complete the lesson from Raspberrypi.org.  Then complete all enhancements.

Upload your finished class to the repository

Enhancements:

1. Add a shuffle() method to randomise the order of the cards in the deck.

2. Add a method to check whether a particular card is present in the deck or not.

3. Add a deal() method to deal cards from the deck. How many cards will you deal to how many players?

4. Create a Hand class to model the cards stored in a playerâ€™s hand

Discussion Questions:

1. If you wanted to implement a game of rummy that uses two decks of cards.  What changes, if any, would you have to make to your class?  Explain.

2. Which statement is the correct way of stating the relationship.  The hand class uses the deck class or the deck class uses the hand class.  Explain by referencing your programming.

3. Explain why this statement is incorrect.  "If you use the deck class for the poker game than those cards will be gone if you were to use the deck class for the Go Fish game."    

4. Good OOP occurs when a class can be inherited and slightly modified to meet another need.  The Deck class is an example of a poker deck.  A pinochle deck only uses 9-A each suit but each card is doubled (i.e. It has two Ace of Spades).  Explain changes you would make to the Deck Class to make a pinochle deck?
